    <h3>About the page</h3>
    <p>Here for U is a website created specifically for U. This is your safe space to openly talk about your struggles and feelings anonymously and get support from one another. </p>

    <p>Our main objective is to build a peer to peer online support group where you get to express anything you want, as well as, give support to other people. </p>

    <p>We intend to make this haven your freedom wall. Express whatever it is that’s hurting you right now, for other people to read, empathize, understand and support. We encourage you to talk about your feelings without fear of judgement. </p>

    <p>No emails, contact details or names needed. You can even log in as a guest user. And for others, you can log in to give love, validation and support to the people who have shared their struggles on the site.</p>

    <p>And lastly, this is not a site where u seek for professional help. Again, this is an effort to create and maintain a peer to peer online support group where in anyone can express what they want and how they feel without judgement.</p> 

    <p>We are here for u, to listen and understand whatever it is your going through. Your life is full of worth, your story matters, and you are important.</p> 

    <p class="font-italic">“Last June 26, 2020, I released my latest single, Here for U, and I got an overwhelming response, as to how much the song has affected all of you. First of all, I got people expressing all kinds of struggles and how the song is helping them overcome a lot of things. But frankly, the song is not enough for me to help, I wanted something tangible that can have a greater impact on your lives right now other than my music.  And seeing how mental heath is deteriorating in this day and age, I looked through some reading materials to find ways to help. I also asked suggestions and ideas from my peers in regards to the website. I found out that engagement in online support groups empowers patients through exchanging information, sharing experiences, and providing emotional support (van Uden-Kraan et al., 2008). Given the anonymity and lack of non-verbal cues of online comm, people perceive there is less risk in sharing their stigmatized issues to others and thus tend to be more open (Bargh, McKenna, and Fitzsimons, 2002; Tidwell and Walther, 2002). ‪Open online discussions often result in expanded knowledge,better decisions,and a sense of control (Barak et al., 2008; Bartlett and Coulson, 2011). These positive consequences can generate individual empowerment which is key to improving health outcomes (Corrigan and Rao, 2012)‬. Online support groups help individuals to forge relationships that might not be possible offline, leading to increased social support and reduced feelings of isolation (Barak et al., 2008; Berger et al., 2005). After, I connected with Chiekko to create it, and I guess, long story short, that’s how Here for U was created.”</p>
